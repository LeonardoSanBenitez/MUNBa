# Theorem 2.5 (Solution characterization)

`catalog.json`'s `theorem_2_5_solution_characterization`. Paper statement: the coefficient vector
`α = (α_r, α_f)` from Theorem 2.3 is exactly the (elementwise-reciprocal) fixed point of the 2x2
Gram-matrix equation `G^T G α = 1/α` (Eq. 6), i.e. writing it out (Eq. 7):

  `α_r ‖g_r‖² + α_f ⟪g_f,g_r⟫ = 1/α_r`,
  `α_f ‖g_f‖² + α_r ⟪g_f,g_r⟫ = 1/α_f`.

## Direct corollary of Theorem 2.3, no new machinery needed

The paper's own proof is pure substitution: dot Theorem 2.3's characterization
`g̃* = α_r g_r + α_f g_f` with `g_r` and with `g_f`, using bilinearity of the inner product. That
is exactly what this file does — a bilinearity computation, no calculus. `catalog.json`'s
`known_issues_in_paper` flags the paper's own "up to scaling" qualifier on this theorem as sitting
oddly against Theorem 2.3's proof, which pins `α_r, α_f` down EXACTLY (not up to a common
scalar) — this file inherits `Optimality.lean`'s resolution of that (the `ε=√2` normalization) and
states Theorem 2.5 as an EXACT equality throughout, consistent with `theorem_2_3_optimality_
condition`'s own conclusion.

The `1/α_r`, `1/α_f` on the right-hand side are literally `utility g_r gt`, `utility g_f gt`
themselves — this is immediate from how `α_r, α_f` were DEFINED in `Optimality.lean`
(`α_r := (utility g_r gt)⁻¹`), not a separate fact to prove; the real content of this theorem is
the LEFT-hand side (the Gram-matrix expression) matching them.
